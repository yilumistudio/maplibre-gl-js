Devs should work on other branches and use PR to make changes to main branch.

It's a public repo due to github policy. We may copy it to a new private repo

work.

git checkout sgmaptest # switch branch
git pull

# Sync from upstream
We should normally hold off syncing from upstream (maplibre/maplibre-gl-js:main)   
if we have a stable version.
